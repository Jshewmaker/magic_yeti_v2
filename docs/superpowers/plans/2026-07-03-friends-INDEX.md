# Friends Feature — Plan Index

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-friends-feature-design.md
Branch: feat/friends-hardening

| Plan | Scope (spec phases) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A `2026-07-03-friends-a-backend-foundation.md` | Functions + rules + private PIN (1) | complete |
| B (not yet written) | Legacy gate + game fan-out (2–3) | pending |
| C (not yet written) | Social graph rules + blocking (4–5) | pending |
| D (not yet written) | Profile page + cleanup (6–7) | pending |

**DEPLOY GATE:** before the first `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`, export
the project's CURRENT production rules from the Firebase console and diff them
against `firestore.rules` — the console rules were never versioned and may contain
grants this repo doesn't know about. Deployment is run by Josh, not by an agent.
